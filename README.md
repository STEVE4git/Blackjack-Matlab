# BlackJack in MatLab



The project is required to use snake_case everywhere for consistent naming.

That means all variables are typed like this "stop_sign, marty_number" All lowercase with an underscore between names!

Main game file from which the game starts (entry-point): blackjack_game.m


File Maintainers:

blackjack_game.m -> Stephen

graphics_render.m -> Bruce

mouse_events.m -> Fiorella
